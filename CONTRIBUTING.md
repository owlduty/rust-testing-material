# Contributing

Feel free to open a pull request if you know good Rust testing material.

## Process

Whenever you find a promising resource, project, talk or video, take the time to review and evaluate the
content quality. If you decide the resource is a good fit for this curated list and can add value to the Rust testing ecosystem, then open a pull request.

If you're unsure about it, this is also a good opportunity to contribute by opening a pull request and gathering feedback. We will decide together!

Due to the blackout protesting, this may not be a viable long-term source. However `r/rust`
mods haven't closed the subreddit, and it still has activity ([read alternative rust discussion venues](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/14921t7/alternative_rust_discussion_venues/)):
